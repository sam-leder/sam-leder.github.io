                <p><u>Dilithium</u></p>
                <p>+ Fast key generation and signing, relatively small signatures</p>
                <p>- Module lattice may potentially introduce vulnerabilities</p>
                <br>
                
                <p><u>Falcon</u></p>
                <p>+ Small sizes and fast verification</p>
                <p>- Design makes it difficult to put side-channel countermeasures in place, module lattice may potentially introduce vulnerabilities</p>
                <br>
                
                <p><u>SPHINCS+</u></p>
                <p>+ Established high security, based on simple and strong assumptions, small public key</p>
                <p>- Large signatures and slower performance, especially when signing</p>
                <br>
                
                <p><u>XMSS</u></p>
                <p>+ Strong security, size relatively small, fast verification</p>
                <p>- State is hard to handle, reducing applicability drastically</p>

                <h3>Scoring system</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The schemes are scored as follows. For every question, a score between 0 and 5 is given to each scheme.
                    This score depends on your answer, with higher scores given to schemes that fit best with your answer.
                    If you decide to answer questions marked as expert questions, these take precedence over the regular question
                    covering the same topic. At the end, each final score is normalized to be between 0 and 100 and displayed,
                    as it is above.</p>
