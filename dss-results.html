                <h3>Brief descriptions of the schemes</h3>
                <br>

                <p><strong>ML-DSA</strong>,
                also known as Dilithium, is a signature scheme based on module lattices. It has been selected by NIST
                for standardization and is recommended as primary algorithm. ML-DSA provides high efficiency in creating
                signatures as well as generating keys.</p>
                <p>• <u>Strengths:</u> Fast key generation and signing, relatively small signatures</p>
                <p>• <u>Weaknesses:</u> Somewhat less conservative approach</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Falcon</strong>,
                is quite similar to ML-DSA: it is also based on module lattices and has similar efficiency.
                NIST also selected Falcon, and recommends it for applications requiring smaller signatures than ML-DSA is able to create.
                Falcon can also verify signatures faster than ML-DSA.</p>
                <p>• <u>Strengths:</u> Small sizes and fast verification</p>
                <p>• <u>Weaknesses:</u> Design makes it difficult to put side-channel countermeasures in place,
                    somewhat less conservative approach</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>SL-DSA</strong>,
                also known as SPHINCS+, is a hash-based signature scheme also selected for standardization by NIST.
                It stands out by the fact that it has very small public and secret keys, has good hardware integration
                and is assumed to be very secure, but also is very slow at generating keys, as well as creating and verifying signatures.</p>
                <p>• <u>Strengths:</u> Established high security, based on simple and strong assumptions, small public key</p>
                <p>• <u>Weaknesses:</u> Large signatures and slower performance, especially when signing</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>XMSS</strong>
                is also a hash-based signature scheme. It is the only stateful scheme out of these four, meaning a state has to be maintained
                between operations. This is undesirable in many applications. On the other hand, XMSS does offer efficient operations and strong security.
                XMSS is not in the process of being standardized, but NIST has published a recommendation for it.</p>
                <p>• <u>Strengths:</u> Strong security, size relatively small, fast verification</p>
                <p>• <u>Weaknesses:</u> State is hard to handle, reducing applicability drastically</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h3>Scoring system</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The schemes are scored as follows. For every question number between 2 and 9, a score between 0 and 5 is given to each scheme.
                    This score depends on your answer, with higher scores given to schemes that fit best with your answer.
                    If you decide to answer questions marked as expert questions, these take precedence over the regular question
                    covering the same topic. Questions you marked important count double. At the end, each final score is normalized
                    to be between 0 and 100 and displayed, as it is above.</p>
