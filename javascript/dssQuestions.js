        topic: 'Physical access',
        intro: 'Some schemes are easier to protect against side-channel attacks than others. In a side-channel attack, the attacker makes use of physical properties of a computation (power usage, fluctuations in computation time) to recover partial information on the secret. However, such attacks are only a concern when the attacker has a means to physically analyse the device in your application. The fact that an attacker has a means to access the device running the cryptographic operations is not by itself a security concern. However, it might be critical for your application to make sure that the secret key is not leaked by the device.',

        intro: 'The design of the operations for some cryptographic schemes makes it hard to implement side-channel countermeasures for some of their functionalities. It is therefore helpful to understand which operations in your application need to be fortified.',
