                <p>Kyber is a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) designed to be resistant to cryptanalytic attacks with future powerful 
                    quantum computers. It is used to establish a shared secret between two communicating parties without an (IND-CCA2) 
                    attacker in the transmission system being able to decrypt it. This asymmetric cryptosystem uses a variant of the 
                    learning with errors lattice problem as its basic trapdoor function. It won the NIST competition for the first 
                    post-quantum cryptography (PQ) standard.</p>
                <br>
                <p>FrodoKEM is a family of key-encapsulation mechanisms that are designed to be conservative yet practical post-quantum 
                    constructions whose security derives from cautious parameterizations of the well-studied learning with errors problem, 
                    which in turn has close connections to conjectured-hard problems on generic, algebraically unstructured lattices.</p>

                <p>McEliece is an asymmetric encryption algorithm developed in 1978 by Robert McEliece. It was the first such scheme to 
                    use randomization in the encryption process. The algorithm has never gained much acceptance in the cryptographic 
                    community, but is a candidate for "post-quantum cryptography", as it is immune to attacks using Shor's algorithm 
                    and - more generally - measuring coset states using Fourier sampling.
                    The algorithm is based on the hardness of decoding a general linear code (which is known to be NP-hard). 
                    <!-- For a description of the private key, an error-correcting code is selected for which an efficient decoding algorithm 
                    is known, and which is able to correct t errors. The original algorithm uses binary Goppa codes 
                    (subfield codes of algebraic geometry codes of a genus-0 curve over finite fields of characteristic 2); 
                    these codes can be efficiently decoded, thanks to an algorithm due to Patterson. 
                    The public key is derived from the private key by disguising the selected code as a general linear code. -->

                <h4>Scoring system</h4>
                <p>The schemes are scored as follows. For every question, [TBD]</p>
