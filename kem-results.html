                <br>
                <p>Below you can see and review your answers. After that, a score on the scale 0-100 is displayed for each of the
                    candidate schemes along with brief advantages and drawbacks of the schemes.
                    Below that, an explanation of the scoring method is also available.</p>
                <br>
                Independently of your answers, we advise to use PQC algorithms in <div class="tooltip">hybrid mode<span class="tooltiptext">Usage of classical and post-quantum cryptography together</span></div> when possible.

                <h3>Pros and cons of the schemes</h3>
                <br>

                <p><u>ML-KEM</u></p>
                <p>+ Very efficient, relatively small sizes, simple to implement in hardware</p>
                <br>

                <p><u>FrodoKEM</u></p>
                <p>+ More conservative choice than module lattices</p>
                <p>- Smaller session keys (requires more frequent session refreshing). Larger sizes and slower performance than module lattices</p>
                <br>

                <p><u>McEliece</u></p>
                <p>+ Very conservative choice, one of the oldest PQC schemes developed, fairly efficient, small ciphertexts</p>
                <p>- Very large public keys</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h3>Scoring system</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The schemes are scored as follows. For every question number between 2 and 8, a score between 0 and 5 is given to each scheme.
                    This score depends on your answer, with higher scores given to schemes that fit best with your answer.
                    If you decide to answer questions marked as expert questions, these take precedence over the regular question
                    covering the same topic. Questions marked important count double. At the end, each final score is normalized to be between 0 and 100 and displayed,
                    as it is above.</p>
