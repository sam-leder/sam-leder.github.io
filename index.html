                <p>Welcome to the <strong>PQChoiceAssistant!</strong></p>
                <p>Here you can get advice on the feasibility of various post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.</p>
                <p>We currently support Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital Signature Scheme (DSS) algorithms.</p>
                <p>By answering relevant questions about your situation,
                    you are able to see recommendations on the most well-suited option.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Please choose one of the following options:</p>

                <br>
                <p>The PQChoiceAssistant is a tool developed by TNO and CWI,
                    with the support of Fox Crypto, NXP, Technolution and Compumatica.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With the advent of quantum computers, encryption methods have to change.
                    Popular options such as RSA are not quantum-safe, and so many users will have to migrate to other schemes
                    that do protect against the quantum threat. However, it is not always easy to determine what scheme to choose,
                    as there are multiple options with different strengths and weaknesses relevant to specific applications.</p>
                <br>
                <p>All information entered in the PQChoiceAssistant is handled locally and all calculations are done in the browser,
                    so no information is stored or viewed by other parties.</p>
                <p>For this reason, the tool can also be used offline. You can easily download the website from
                    <a href="github.com">Github</a> [link TBD].</p>
